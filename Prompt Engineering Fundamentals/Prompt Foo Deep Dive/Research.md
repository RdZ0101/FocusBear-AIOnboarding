 1. Explain in your own words the core concepts of Prompt Foo and how it can be used to tune LLM prompts.

 Prompt Foo is a framework that helps developers systematically test and improve prompts for AI language models through a structured, data-driven approach.

 Core Concepts:

    1. Test-Driven Development

        Create test cases with specific inputs (e.g., "Translate 'where is the library' to Spanish") and define success criteria before refining prompts.

    2. Side-by-Side Comparisons

        Test multiple prompts or AI models simultaneously to identify which performs best for different scenarios.

    3. Automatic Grading

        Use three methods to evaluate outputs:

            Rule-based checks (e.g., "Must include 'Dónde está la bibliotec'")

            Semantic analysis (measures meaning similarity)

            AI-as-judge (another LLM scores response quality)

    Tuning Process

    1. Identify Weaknesses

        Find out where the present prompts fall short (e.g., failing to handle malicious inputs or processing technical language).

    2. Experiment Safely

        Without endangering production systems, compare radical prompt adjustments to a series of test scenarios.

    3. Optimize Key Metrics

        See how adjustments impact quantifiable results to balance conflicting demands like reaction time, accuracy, and cost.

    4. Practical Applications

        Improve customer support bots to reliably adhere to brand voice standards.

        Test prompts against more than 100 injection attack templates to strengthen security.

        Find prompts that yield comparable results from smaller/less expensive models to cut down on API expenses.
